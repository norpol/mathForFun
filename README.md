Mathematics
===========

##WTF?
I am studing various mathematical topics. For the beginning the topics I'm studing are limited to what I'm required by final exams in math. Additionally I try to build some nice documents, mostly because I like a nice structure for everything I am doing.


##Structure
There are two main folders. One is thought for **examples**, and the others are for **calculations** I am working on(that will maybe contain scans of my documents). Additionally there is also a **media**-folder which will provide media(documents, videos) for various mathematical topics.

 - [`README.md`](/README.md)
 - [`TODO.md`](/TODO.md)
 - [`STUDY.md`](/STUDY.md)
 - [`LAZY.md`](/LAZY.md)
 - `/examples` + `/$TOPIC`
 - `/calculations` + `/$TOPIC` + `/`
 - `/media`

##Topics
 - Basic Maths(Formulas)
 - Cost Functions(Kostenfunktionen)
 - Radioactive Decay
