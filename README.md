_WORK IN PROGRESS_

##WTF?
I am studying various mathematical topics. For the beginning the topics I'm studing are limited to what I'm required by(for?) final exams in math. In addition I try to ?build? some nice documents, mostly because I like a nice structure for everything I am doing. Be careful, most informations might be oversimplified and/or wrong - additionally I'm a pretty lazy writer, so sorry for switching between german/english + making a lot of mistakes(spelling and grammatic).


##Structure
There are two main folders. One is thought for **examples**, and the others are for **calculations** I am working on(that will maybe contain scans of my documents). Additionally there is also a **media**-folder which will provide media(documents, videos) for various mathematical topics.

 - [`README.md`](/README.md)
 - [`TERMS.md`](/TERMS.md)
 - [`VOCS.md`](/VOCS.md)
 - [`STUDY.md`](/STUDY.md)
 - [`TODO.md`](/TODO.md)
 - [`LAZY.md`](/LAZY.md)
 - `/examples` + `/$TOPIC`
 - `/calculations` + `/$TOPIC`
 - `/media`

##Topics
 - Basic Maths(Formulas)
 - Quadratische Funktionen
  - Wurfbeispiele, Fallbeispiele
 - Maxima and Minima
 - Cost Functions(Kostenfunktionen)
  - Curve Sketching
- Exponential Functions
 - Radioactive Decay
