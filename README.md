Mathematics
===========

##WTF?
I am studing various mathematical topics. For the beginning, most of them are thought for my final exams - but hopefully I will use them also in future.


##Structure
We have two main folders. One is thought for examples, and the others for calculations I am working on(that will maybe contain scans of my documents). Additionally there are also media-folders which will provide media(documents, videos) for various mathematical topics.

 - [`README.md`](/README.md)
 - [`TODO.md`](/TODO.md)
 - [`STUDY.md`](/STUDY.md)
 - `/examples` + `/$TOPIC`
 - `/calculations` + `/$TOPIC` + `/`
 - `/media`

##Topics
 - Basic Maths(Formulas)
 - Cost Functions(Kostenfunktionen)
 - Radioactive Decay
